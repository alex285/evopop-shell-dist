This is work in progress, it inherits Adwaita theming and it has known and uknown unfinished things and bugs. **Supports** GNOME Shell 3.16 **only.**
Current version is [0.1.7](https://github.com/alex285/evopop-shell-dist/wiki/Whats-New)

###Very known bugs

- Popup menu colors fade in/out is broken. That is GNOME Shell bug, that we cannot work around
with multiple colors :/

- **Left 2 Right support**, is not really supported as there is no way to try it. This will mostly lead
on padding and radius bugs
